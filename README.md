## Purpose

Build an education management system similar to campus connect. The system has three types of users: students, teachers,
and administrators. The system will have information on students and teachers such as personal information and class
information
Students will be able to add/remove classes, check class schedules, and download
The teacher will post class information, types of classes, and when they happen
The administrator will have overarching access as a debugger.

* Milestone 2: Create project data persistence and some services of each module.
* MileStone 3: Updated few tables based on requirement, Implemented swagger documentation and created few customizes services
